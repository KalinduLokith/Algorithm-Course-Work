# Algorithm-Course-Work
This project is based on solving sliding puzzles using various algorithms. Sliding puzzles are grid-based puzzles where you need to rearrange numbered tiles or pieces to form a specific pattern or order. Your task is to develop a program that can solve sliding puzzles efficiently.


Tasks to be performed:

Task 1 : Project Setup
Set up a project in the programming language of your choice (Java or C++) as per the guidelines provided in the course. Make sure your code follows clear coding conventions and guidelines.

Task 2 : Data Structure Implementation
Choose and implement a suitable data structure that can represent sliding puzzles. The data structure should provide the necessary functionality to manipulate and solve the puzzles efficiently. Consider the specific requirements of sliding puzzles and design the data structure accordingly.

Task 3 : Puzzle Input Parser
Develop a simple parser that can read the description of a sliding puzzle from an input file. The input file will contain the initial configuration of the puzzle, specifying the position of each tile or piece. Your parser should be able to extract the necessary information and initialize the data structure accordingly.

Task 4 : Puzzle Solving Algorithm
Implement an algorithm to solve the given sliding puzzle. You can choose any suitable algorithm for this task, such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), A* search, or any other relevant algorithm. The implementation should produce additional output to show the steps taken to solve the puzzle.

Task 5 : Outputting Puzzle Solution
Make your program output the solution to the sliding puzzle once it has been solved. Display the moves or steps required to reach the final configuration from the initial configuration. Ensure that the solution is correctly displayed and can be easily understood.

Task 6 : Performance Analysis
Write a brief report (maximum 3 A4 pages) containing the following:
a) A short explanation of your choice of data structure and algorithm for solving sliding puzzles.
b) Provide a demonstration of your algorithm on two benchmark examples, one of which is relatively easy and the other one is more complex. Include the initial and final configurations of the puzzles, as well as the steps taken to solve them.
c) Perform a performance analysis of your algorithmic design and implementation. This can be based on empirical data obtained by solving different puzzles of varying complexity or on theoretical considerations. Include a suggested order-of-growth classification (Big-O notation) to analyze the time complexity of your algorithm.
